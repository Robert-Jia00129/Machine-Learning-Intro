# This folder records my everday learning from github
I use this floder as a place to write my daily progress and practise markdown syntax. 
## Besides my daily progress report, there is a cheatsheet on markdown language included in this file. 
The cheatsheet included is extracted online [^1]


   
## May 12 Updates

### Finished Today: 
- how to make smaller headings and organize the .md file

### Tasks for tomorrow: 
- Is there a more convenient way for me to upload these everday report? 

Also, I can start adding notes about specific tasks in the corresponding files from tomorrow. 
For example, add a .md explanation about the CNN networks in the CNN file. 

## May 13 Updates 
### Finished Today: 
- Learnt about markdown language
- Learnt about how to create repositories and how to make new commits 
- Downloaded GitHub Desktop and Pulled documents from online repositories. 

### Tasks for tomorrow: 
- how to use terminal to commit and make changes (but I guess it's unneccessary because I already have github desktop. 
- How do I synchronize my files on my local desktop onto the online repositories. 
- I created a file in the folder, but I'm unable to push it onto the online repository. 
- The folder does not show up

### Solved: 
- ~~This previous problem was solved by adding new documents in the folder!~~
- ~~By downloading github desktop, it is much easier for me to upload files and make comits~~

## May 13 updates
